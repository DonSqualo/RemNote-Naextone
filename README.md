# A first prototype of Naext.one

This plugin allows you to control your attention.
Use the power up Naext to set the **Ressonance** of any rem, a number between 0 and 100 that tells you how important or meaningful this rem feels right now.

Features:

Set Ressonance with the shortcuts
Key **1**: sets ressonance to 10
**2**: 30
**3**: 50
**4**: 70
**5**: 90

6 marks a task as done and creates a low ranking "Review" rem
7 removes the rem from the Naext queue and 
0 sets the Ressonance to 100, which always forces you to take action.
